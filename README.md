This is my (Jerome Sipin) submission for the Leaflet homework.

This was another tough one, but I was able to finish this assignment
by leaning heavily on the classwork examples and a lot of Google searches on how
to do things that I didn't know how to do (for example, the legend, or the circle
markers).

The file layout for this assignment is pretty standard. The main page can be
found in the same folder as this readme. It has not been modified. The Javascript
can be found in the static/js folder. I have added a bit of css for the legend of the
map under the static/css folder.
